FxTracker is a Flutter-based application that allows you to check the current currency exchange rates based on data provided by the National Bank of Poland (NBP). With this application, you can track currency rates and stay updated with their changes.

## Key Features

- **Support for all NBP currencies**: The FxTracker app enables you to check the exchange rates for all currencies available in the National Bank of Poland's A table. With integration with the NBP API, you can be confident that you are receiving the latest data.

- **Offline Availability**: In case of no internet connection, the app displays an appropriate message, and the data is automatically fetched once the connection is restored.

- **Favorite Currencies**: In the details of a specific currency, you can add or remove it from your favorites. This allows for quick access to important currency rates without the need to search for them every time.

- **Historical Currency Charts**: FxTracker allows you to view historical currency charts. Users can select a time range (30, 60, and 90 days, 6 and 12 months) and see how a particular currency has performed in pair to Polish z≈Çoty.

- **Theme Switching**: FxTracker enables users to choose their preferred theme. You can customize the app's appearance by selecting a light, dark, or automatic theme that follows the system theme.

- **Configurable Chart Settings**: In the FxTracker app settings, users can customize the chart appearance. The option to round the chart enables displaying rounded values on the axes. Additionally, users can choose whether to enable vibration (HapticFeedback) upon interacting with the chart, adding interactivity and feedback while using the app.
